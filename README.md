# Deep Dark Delve
Deep Dark Delve is a turn-based tactical role-playing game. 
### About
You and your small crew must pick your way carefully through treacherous caverns and long-forgotten dungeons in this turn-based tactical RPG!

Slay creatures, gather treasure, and gain enough power to overcome the guardians that would halt your progress into the lost chambers of ancient kings and claim the most glitterful shiny artifacts you've ever seen! Dungeon delving is expensive though, manage your team's resources carefully or risk being lost to the dark.
